# Automated Deployment and Orchestration of Containerized Python Applications

**Description:** This project aims to streamline the deployment, configuration, and orchestration of a simple Python application across multiple servers.  Whether for development, testing, or production environments, this automation solution enhances the deployment workflow for containerized Python applications.

## Overview
This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with a diverse set of cutting-edge technologies, including Docker, Ansible, and Docker Swarm. The primary goal of this project is for me to get more practical knowledge in deploying, configuring, and orchestrating web applications in a distributed environment.
